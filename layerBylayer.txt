Internet on the Move 

This divides topic by layer, using the TCP/IP protocol suite (aka Five-layer internet model)

Global Scenario
- countries with excellent coverage i.e. sweden, finland, south korea
- countries with poor coverage
- what were the factors that lead to these differences 

UK Governments policy and legication

- Broadband Delivery UK
- Wireless Commons Licience 
- Net Neutrality Debate 

UK Statistics
- Using of smartphones
- Comparion of the coverage claimed by carriers and the reality
- Coverage of 3G/4G provided by UK's main carriers
- results of population survey about people without internet access
